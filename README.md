# bullet-hell-game-SDL

2D bullet hell game made in SDL 2.0 with custom graphics. It's working, however it's more like prototype - there is no actual objective other than dodging bullets.

Student project made for first semester of Computer Science, uploaded to GitHub later. Code could be cleaner using OOP, but it was discouraged during first semester.
